## Important Rules Notes

1. **Wounds cannot be discarded** for Improvisation's effect (per card text)
2. **Tranquility is a healing card** and cannot be used once combat has started
3. **Crystallize** cannot produce gold or black crystals (those exist only as mana tokens)
4. **Concentration** can only combine with Action cards (not Spells, Units, or Artifacts)
5. **Threaten's powered effect** causes Reputation -1 penalty
