When attacking another player or Volkare across a wall, consider the target to be fortified. When assaulting a fortified site across a wall, consider the garrison to be double fortified.

**Provoking:** Your move does not provoke rampaging enemies if the target space of that move is separated from the enemy by a wall (i.e. rampaging enemies never attack you across a wall).
