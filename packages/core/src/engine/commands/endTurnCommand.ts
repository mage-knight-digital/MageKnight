/**
 * End turn command - handles ending a player's turn
 *
 * This command is irreversible and:
 * - Clears the command stack (no more undo)
 * - Expires "turn" duration modifiers
 * - Moves play area cards to discard
 * - Draws cards up to hand limit (no mid-round reshuffle)
 * - Resets turn state (hasMovedThisTurn, hasTakenActionThisTurn, movePoints, etc.)
 * - Advances to next player (or next round if everyone has gone)
 * - At round end: reshuffles all players' cards and draws fresh hands
