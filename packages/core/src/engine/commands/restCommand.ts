/**
 * REST command - handles resting to discard cards
 *
 * REST is an alternative to taking a regular turn. Instead of playing cards for effects,
 * the player discards cards to cycle their hand. ALL discarded cards (including wounds)
 * go to the discard pile - this is NOT healing.
 *
 * Two types of rest:
 * - Standard Rest: Discard exactly one non-wound card (plus any wounds)
 * - Slow Recovery: When hand is ALL wounds, discard exactly one wound
