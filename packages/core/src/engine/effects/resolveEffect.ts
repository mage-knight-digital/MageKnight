 * Effect resolver - applies card effects to game state

 * - GainInfluence: add influence points
 * - GainAttack: accumulate attack value for combat
 * - GainBlock: accumulate block value for combat
 * - GainHealing: track healing (wounds not yet implemented)
 * - Compound: resolve all sub-effects
 * - Choice: requires player selection (Phase 2)
